I've been working as an IT Technician/Administrator for many years. Then I decided to create my own company and I worked for different clients.
	- Public company helping homeless people.
	- Architects
The main reason why I closed the company is that I'm not a commercial and I couldn't picture myself managing a company for the rest of my life.

What should I do now ? I decided to try something different.

Then I decided to get back to school and got my diploma in VFX.


Strength:
- I'm good at multitasking
- Can work under pressure
- Calm and diplomat

- Flexible
- I have a strong discipline because motivated
- Autonome and self-motivated
- I can appreciate the views from other people, I'm not stubborn and I like collaboration with others.
