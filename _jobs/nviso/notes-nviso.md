I have worked in many types of environments and enjoyed learning new things from each. I would say that while I donâ€™t prefer a particular environment, I really like working with people who are committed to getting things done and who are passionate about their work.

I can have difficulties to schedule my time. The reason is that i have spend too much time on details.


First of all, thank you very much calling and taking the time to consider my application.
My name is Gregory Graindorge. I like to see myself as a cyber security enthusiast. The reason why I say that it's because I passionate about cyber security and I spend my days doing CTF on Hackthebox. 

Just to give you a bit more insights about my background, I started my carreer in 2008. Back then I was IT Technician / System administrator. I did that inside different companies and then I decided to give myself a chance to be a freelancer. 


Being a freelancer was very challenging on many levels. I was doing the job but at some point I realized that I wasn't really enjoying the be a freelancer. The reason is that I'm more a technical person than a commercial. I can face a client or make a short training session to a client but I'm not very good at negociating contracts. So, at some point I thought it was for the best to move on and try something else. I needed to have a break from IT and make something different. 

So, just like that I got back to school. I got my diploma, I applied to different companies and I got a contract in Munich. 6 Months later, I was back to Bekgium and again I applied to different companies, but the problem is that I got only offers from Canada. Which is somehow great because I like Canada, I was really keen to go there. But I have my son here in Belgium and despite all my efforts, I haven't been able to find a way to take him with me and go to Canada. So, I had to make a decision I decided to quit vfx and get back to IT. 

I didn't know exactly where start so I heard that Cisco released a new version of the CCNA certification. I thought it was a nice way to catch up on everything. Then after having the CCNA, I heard about hackthebox and tryhackme so I thought it was a good idea to give a try, just to challenge myself. Because I was really enjoying hackthebox I decided to get more into cyber security and specially pentesting. A nice way to do that, would be to have the oscp certification.
